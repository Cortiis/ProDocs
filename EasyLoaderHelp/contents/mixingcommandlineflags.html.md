Mixing Command Line Flags with the EasyLoader User Interface {#mixing-command-line-flags-with-the-easyloader-user-interface .title .topictitle1}
============================================================

Command line flags may be mixed with the EasyLoader user interface by using a Windows shortcut. This makes it easier to set flags as your default while being able to override them from the interface. These flags are only available from the command line.

-   Create a shortcut to EasyLoader.
-   Right-click and choose `Send To`{.uicontrol} and `Desktop`{.uicontrol} to create the shortcut on the desktop, or right-click and drag to move a shortcut to a folder of your choice.
-   Right-click the shortcut and choose `Properties`{.uicontrol}.
-   Under the `Shortcut`{.uicontrol} tab, within the `Target`{.uicontrol} edit box, add the appropriate command line flags to the end of the line, separated by spaces.

When EasyLoader is run from that shortcut, the specified flags will be in effect.
