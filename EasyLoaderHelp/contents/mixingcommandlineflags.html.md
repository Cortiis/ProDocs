Mixing Command Line Flags with the EasyLoader User Interface {#mixing-command-line-flags-with-the-easyloader-user-interface .title .topictitle1}
============================================================

Command line flags may be mixed with the EasyLoader user interface by
using a Windows shortcut. This makes it easier to set flags as your
default while being able to override them from the interface. These
flags are only available from the command line.

-   Create a shortcut to EasyLoader.
-   Right-click and choose <span class="ph uicontrol">Send To</span> and
    <span class="ph uicontrol">Desktop</span> to create the shortcut on
    the desktop, or right-click and drag to move a shortcut to a folder
    of your choice.
-   Right-click the shortcut and choose <span
    class="ph uicontrol">Properties</span>.
-   Under the <span class="ph uicontrol">Shortcut</span> tab, within the
    <span class="ph uicontrol">Target</span> edit box, add the
    appropriate command line flags to the end of the line, separated
    by spaces.

When EasyLoader is run from that shortcut, the specified flags will be
in effect.
