Server Table Processing Options {#server-table-processing-options .title .topictitle1}
===============================

<div class="body conbody">

<span class="ph uicontrol">Exclusive User of Table</span> – You can
significantly speed up load time on large tables if you know that you
are the only one attempting to update or upload the table. If you do not
select this option, EasyLoader verifies after each commit that no other
updates are made to the table while it is being uploaded. Selecting this
option prevents this test from occurring, which can improve runtime
performance for large tables.

<span class="ph uicontrol">Create Primary Key</span>
:   By selecting this check box, a primary key is created for the <span
    class="ph uicontrol">Create New Table</span> and <span
    class="ph uicontrol">Replace Existing Table</span> operations. This
    primary key is created in the column SW\_MEMBER for SpatialWare,
    MI\_PRINX for Oracle, or MI\_SQL\_REC\_NUM for XY and MICODE. These
    columns are sequential numbers that are generated by EasyLoader.
    These columns are always created, but do not have to be a
    primary key. For the Append To Existing Table operation, the primary
    key is not created.

<span class="ph uicontrol">Grant Public Full Access to Table</span>
:   The PUBLIC is granted all access to the server table.

<span class="ph uicontrol">Create Spatial Index</span>
:   By selecting this check box, a spatial index
    (called &lt;tablename&gt;ind) is created for the tables on the
    geometry column. You may also build your own spatial index to suit
    your specific needs. If you choose to do this, clear this check box
    to save loading time.
:   By selecting this check box, a spatial index
    (called &lt;tablename&gt;\_SX) is created for Oracle Spatial tables
    on the geometry column . The index tiling level is based on the
    SDO\_TUNE.ESTIMATE\_TILING\_LEVEL function. For tables with fewer
    than 7500 rows, the tiling level is restricted to 8. After the index
    is built the ANALYZE table function is run on the index table. The
    spatial index is R-Tree for Oracle 8.17 or later.

<span class="ph uicontrol">Create IDENTITY Column (SQL Server only)</span>
:   Select this check box if you wish to create the primary key
    column (SW\_MEMBER) with IDENTITY properties. When this feature is
    in use, the primary key column values are generated automatically by
    SQL Server. You do not need to fill in the key manually when a new
    row is inserted.

<span class="ph uicontrol">Create Indices on Other Columns</span>
:   Select this check box if you want to index additional columns when
    uploading a new table or replacing an existing table. By default
    this box is not selected.
:   When you select this check box and click <span
    class="ph uicontrol">OK</span>, the table upload begins and the
    following dialog box displays.
:   \
    <div class="imagecenter">

    ![](images/dialog_Reset_Index_Columns.png){.image .imagecenter
    width="240"}

    </div>

    \
:   The <span class="ph uicontrol">Table Name</span> text box shows
    which server table is selected for indexing. The <span
    class="ph uicontrol">Column List</span> shows each column followed
    by its data type. Select a check box to select that column for
    indexing on the server table. Clear a check box if you do not want
    to index that column.
:   <div class="note note">

    <span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If the column name length is
    too long, the index creation fails. The limit to the size of the
    index name varies per database.

    </div>

<span class="ph uicontrol">Convert Date and Time columns to Datetime on the server</span>
:   This option is automatically handled by the software, with selects
    it when connected to a DBMS, such as Oracle and Access, that does
    not have date or time data types and unselects it for a DBMS, such
    as SQL Server Spatial or PostGIS, that has both date and time
    data types.

<span class="ph uicontrol">Style Column</span>
:   This option allows you to specify whether per-row styles are loaded
    with the data. You can also specify the name of the column in the
    text box next to the <span class="ph uicontrol">Style Column</span>
    check box. The default column name is MI\_STYLE.
:   <div class="note note">

    <span class="notetitle">Note:</span> To load per-row styles, the
    MapInfo Map catalog for the database must contain the following
    columns: RENDITIONTYPE, RENDITIONCOLUMN, RENDITIONTABLE,
    and NUMBER\_ROWS. For more information, see [MAPINFO\_MAPCATALOG
    Table Structure](contents/mapcatalogtablestructure.html){.-
    .topic/xref .ajaxLink}.

    </div>

<span class="ph uicontrol">Commit Interval</span>
:   Use this option to specify a commit interval for uploading.
    EasyLoader commits the inserted records when the commit interval
    is reached. The default commit interval is 1000. If the commit
    interval is set to 0 (zero), the whole range of records is inserted
    as a single transaction, before a commit is issued.

<span class="ph uicontrol">Schema</span>
:   Use this option to specify a schema to which you want to upload
    the table. This is valid for SQL Server 2005 servers
    and PostgresSQL/PostGIS.
