Spatial Object Type Options {#spatial-object-type-options .title .topictitle1}
===========================

<div class="body conbody">

Choose from <span class="ph uicontrol">MapInfo SpatialWare</span> or
<span class="ph uicontrol">Oracle Spatial</span> (depending on the type
of connection), <span class="ph uicontrol">MICODE</span> (XY with
MapInfo Key), <span class="ph uicontrol">XY</span>, <span
class="ph uicontrol">PostGIS Spatial</span>, or <span
class="ph uicontrol">SQL Server Spatial</span>. The default for loading
spatial data is <span class="ph uicontrol">MapInfo SpatialWare</span> or
<span class="ph uicontrol">Oracle Spatial</span>, if this option is
available; otherwise the <span class="ph uicontrol">MICODE</span> option
is the default.

<span class="ph uicontrol">MapInfo SpatialWare</span>
:   To select this option, the server must be Oracle Spatial or have
    MapInfo SpatialWare installed. Tables are uploaded as spatial data.
    This option is disabled (grayed) if SpatialWare is not installed on
    the server, or if it is not available to the currently
    selected database.

<span class="ph uicontrol">MICODE (XY with MapInfo Key)</span>
:   Use this option if the server is not Oracle Spatial or does not have
    MapInfo SpatialWare installed. This option stores the data as XY
    coordinates on the server and creates the server table as a
    point table. If the MapInfo table to be uploaded is not a point
    table and this option is chosen, the centroid is abstracted and
    stored on the server table, if you instruct it to do so. The
    difference between <span class="ph uicontrol">XY</span> and <span
    class="ph uicontrol">MICODE</span> is that the <span
    class="ph uicontrol">MICODE</span> provides a MapInfo key as the
    spatial index, making its performance superior to <span
    class="ph uicontrol">XY</span>.

<span class="ph uicontrol">XY</span>
:   This option is the same as the <span
    class="ph uicontrol">MICODE</span> option, except that this option
    does not create a spatial index.

<span class="ph uicontrol">PostGIS Spatial</span>
:   Use this option with a spatialized PostGIS database.

<span class="ph uicontrol">SQL Server Spatial</span>
:   Use these options if the server is Microsoft SQL Server Spatial:
:   <span class="ph uicontrol">Auto Select</span> – EasyLoader
    automatically decides whether to upload the geometry object to a
    Geography field (if the geometry object is using a Lat/Long
    coordinate system) or to a Geometry field (if the geometry object is
    using another coordinate system).
:   <span class="ph uicontrol">Always Geometry</span> – EasyLoader
    always uploads the geometry object to a Geometry field, regardless
    of the coordinate system specified for the geometry object.

<div class="note note">

<span class="notetitle">Note:</span> When the <span
class="ph uicontrol">Auto Select</span> option is selected, if for any
reason a geometry object that uses the Lat/Long coordinate system cannot
be uploaded to a Geography field, it will instead be uploaded to a
Geometry field.
