Unsupported Geometries in Oracle, SQL Server, and PostGIS {#unsupported-geometries-in-oracle-sql-server-and-postgis .title .topictitle1}
=========================================================

<div class="body conbody">

Some times when you are creating a Map in MapInfo Pro and you are storing the results in Oracle, SQL Server Spatialware, SQL Server Spatial, or PostGIS, you create maps which use geometries that are not supported by these DBMS engines.

-   **Oracle** does not support arcs, ellipses, rectangles, and rounded rectangles.
-   **SQL Server Spatial** does not support arcs, and lines that do not have distinct points
-   **SQL Server SpatialWare** does not support arcs, ellipses, and rounded rectangles.
-   **PostGIS** does not support arcs, ellipses, rectangles, and rounded rectangles

EasyLoader will skip the unsupported object type and insert the attribute data, it will not dislay a message.

> SQL Server Restriction on Geography Objects

SQL Server uploads invalid Geometry objects and converts them to valid using a SQL server command, but SQL Server does not upload invalid Geography objects. Attempting to upload invalid Geography objects causes EasyLoader to fail. This is a limitation of SQL Server and not of EasyLoader.

Due to this SQL Server limitation, our recommendation is to upload only as Geometry.
