History of EasyLoader Changes {#history-of-easyloader-changes .title .topictitle1}
=============================

This section provides a history of features and enhancements that have been added to EasyLoader since version 11.0.

New in EasyLoader 15.2 {#new-in-easyloader-15.2 .title .sectiontitle}
----------------------

EasyLoader 15.2 is a 32-bit release that works with the MapInfo Pro 15.2 64-bit release. There are no new features or fixes.

MapInfo Pro 15.2 supports unicode and requires the PostgreSQL Unicode ODBC drive. EasyLoader does not yet support unicode and requires the PostgreSQL ANSI ODBC drive. You must have both drivers installed when both products are on the same machine.

New in EasyLoader 15.0 {#new-in-easyloader-15.0 .title .sectiontitle}
----------------------

EasyLoader 15.0 is a 32-bit release that works with the MapInfo Pro 15.0 32-bit release. There are no new features or fixes.

New in EasyLoader 12.5.1 {#new-in-easyloader-12.5.1 .title .sectiontitle}
------------------------

EasyLoader 12.5.1 is a 32-bit release that works with the MapInfo Pro 12.5.1 64-bit release. There are no new features or fixes.

New in EasyLoader 12.5 {#new-in-easyloader-12.5 .title .sectiontitle}
----------------------

There are no new features or fixes.

New in EasyLoader 12.0 {#new-in-easyloader-12.0 .title .sectiontitle}
----------------------

EasyLoader 12.0 supports the following database versions:

-   **PostGIS 2.0** – Note that when uploading files to a PostGIS 2.0 database, spatial objects upload as a geometry spatial data type.
-   **SQL Server 2012** – EasyLoader processes any invalid geography using the SQL Server 2012 MakeValid( ) function, so that the geography is valid.

The server table processing option `Grant Public Access to Table`{.uicontrol} has been changed to `Grant Public Full Access to Table`{.uicontrol}.

This release fixes the following issues:

-   **MIPRO-12309**: A message displays when appending a native table with a MI\_PRINX column in an Oracle Spatial database with an OCI connection, "Table cannot be Appended—It has a different table structure."
-   **MIPRO-12320**: When uploading a table with no geometry into EasyLoader 11.5, an error message appears: "Table cannot be Appended—It has a different table structure."
-   **MIPRO-32642**: EasyLoader is unable to import to “geography” data type in SQL Server 2008 SP2.

    You will need to upgrade to SQL Server 2012. SQL Server 2012 uses the function STIsValid( ) to check if a geography data type is well formed and recognized as a valid object based on its OGC type. The MakeValid( ) function is also used that converts an invalid geography data type into a valid one. In MapInfo Pro 12.0, you can use the extended spatial methods in SQL Server 2012 to manage valid geography data types. Refer to the [SQL Server 2012 MSDN library](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff929337.aspx){.xref} for more information.

New in EasyLoader 11.5.1 {#new-in-easyloader-11.5.1 .title .sectiontitle}
------------------------

EasyLoader 11.5.1 lets you connect to Oracle using your Operating System (OS) authentication (Windows credentials). The `MapInfo Oracle Connect`{.uicontrol} dialog box has a new `Use Operating System Authentication`{.uicontrol} check box to set this option.

When running EasyLoader from the command line with the <span class="keyword option">Connection`{.uicontrol} parameter and connecting with OS authentication, the parameter should contain only the server name (@ServerName) and not a user ID or password. For the database authentication, provide the user ID, password, and server name (UserName/Password@ServerName).

The **/Z** parameter changed in EasyLoader to set the `Auto Select`{.uicontrol} option instead of `Always Geometry`{.uicontrol}.

This release fixes the following issues:

-   **MIPRO-19759**: In EasyLoader, a connection string created in a tab file does not seem to work every time.

-   **MIPRO-21235**: EasyLoader cannot upload geography from the command line in SQL Server 2008.

-   **MIPRO-24515**: Uploading a table with a boolean field to PostGIS does not put the correct TYPE\_NAME on the server side. There is an inconsistency between EasyLoader and MapInfo Professional on how they save data on PostGIS. EasyLoader uploads a logical field as smallint, whereas, MapInfo Professional uploads a logical field as boolean. When you open a first table, uploaded by EasyLoader, in MapInfo Professional the field shows up as smallint. When you open a second table, uploaded by MapInfo Professional, in MapInfo Professional the field shows up as char\[5\].
