The total number of bytes for table names, columns names, primary key constraint names (table name + _PK) and index names (column name + _IX) must not exceed 30 bytes. The number of bytes that each character uses is dependent upon the character set that Oracle is using. If you see the message Identifier is too long, then make server table names or column names shorter. Validating Oracle Data There are two functions that allow you to validate data in Oracle: SDO_GEOM.VALIDATE_GEOMETRY( ) SDO_GEOM.VALIDATE_LAYER( ) These functions may result in validation errors due to the tolerance level set by MapInfo EasyLoader. You may get error messages such as: ORA-13356 adjacent points in a geometry are redundant, or ORA-13022 polygon crosses itself To resolve these errors, reset the tolerance within the USER_SDO-GEOM_METADATA by adjusting them downwards (by a factor of 10) and rerun the validation. If you adjust the tolerance, you must re-create the spatial indexes because they use the tolerance when they are created. To view the unsupported geometries in Oracle, see Unsupported Geometry.

Geography fields hold geometries specified in the Lat/Long coordinate system. Geometry fields hold geometries specified in all other coordinate systems. If you choose to upload to a Geometry field type, then MapInfo EasyLoader runs the SQL Server Spatial MakeValid( ) function to fix any geometry that SQL Server Spatial deems invalid. This may shift point locations for certain geometries. In the Options dialog box, MapInfo EasyLoader enables you to control how the geometry data in a native table is uploaded to SQL Server Spatial. Keep the default selection of Always Geometry to have MapInfo EasyLoader upload geometry objects to Geometry fields regardless of the coordinate system they use. Select Auto Select to have MapInfo EasyLoader automatically decide whether the geometry object is uploaded to a Geography field (in cases where the geometry object uses the Lat/Long coordinate system) or a Geometry field (in cases where the geometry object does not use the Lat/Long coordinate system). When the Auto Select option is selected, if for any reason a geometry object that uses the Lat/Long coordinate system cannot be uploaded to a Geography field, it will instead be uploaded to a Geometry field. To view the Unsupported Geometries in SQL, see Unsupported Geometry. MapInfo EasyLoader supports uploading MapInfo native tables into SQL Server Spatial. SQL Server Spatial allows spatial data to be stored into two data types; Geometry and Geography. SQL Server's rules that define what a valid geometry or geography are different than MapInfo Pro's rules. The SQL Server Spatial's Geography data type does not support: polygons that contain self-intersecting boundaries geography instances that span more than one hemisphere lines/polygon boundaries that have two successive, identical nodes The SQL Server Spatial's Geometry type does not support: polygons that contain self-intersecting boundaries lines/polygon boundaries that have two successive, identical nodes Refer to SQL Server books online for complete information on the rules that define these two types at: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sqlserver/default.aspx This means that you may have geometry data that are valid in a MapInfo TAB format that cannot be loaded into SQL Server Spatial without correction/edits. MapInfo EasyLoader aborts the upload if it comes across the geometry that SQL Server rejects. It will display the primary key of the record that contains the rejected object. A MapInfo Upload Utility Error message displays. You may want to try the following steps to make the geometry acceptable to SQL Server. Use MapInfo Pro's Clean operation on the Object menu to correct the geometry. If your upload was to Geography type and it fails, try loading it to Geometry, correct the instance using the MakeValid( ) method on the Geometry type, and uploading the instance again. You will need a working knowledge of SQL and access to a SQL Server Spatial client to use this approach. Consider the following example. Let us suppose the Geometry update failed for the row (state = 'Florida'). Selectively update the offending geometry, using the MakeValid( ) method. update states_geom set geom = geom.MakeValid( ) where state = 'Florida' Force an operation that does not alter the geometry, but forces a topology construction. Here, we perform a union of the Geometry with its own start point. update states_geom set geom = geom.STUnion(geom.STStartPoint()) where state = 'Florida' Now this query will attempt to create a Geography instance from the reformed Geometry. select state_name, Geography::STGeomFromWKB(geom.STAsBinary(), 4269) from states_geom, where state = 'Florida'","id":9},{"URI":"guide/uploading/uploadingtables.html","Title":"Uploading Tables","Shortdesc":"","Body":"For instructions to start MapInfo EasyLoader, see Getting Started with MapInfo EasyLoader.

Selecting this option prevents this test from occurring, which can improve runtime performance for large tables. Create Primary Key This creates a primary key for the Create New Table and Replace Existing Table operations. This primary key is created in the MI_PRINX column for Oracle Spatial, SQL Server Spatial, and PostGIS, or MI_SQL_REC_NUM for XY and MICODE. These columns contain sequential numbers generated by MapInfo EasyLoader. These columns are always created, but do not have to be a primary key. The Append to Existing Table operation does not create a primary key. Grant Public Full Access This grants PUBLIC read and write access to the server table. Create Spatial Index This creates a spatial index called <tablename>ind on the geometry column of tables. When building your own spatial index, for your specific requirements, clear this check box to save loading time. For Oracle Spatial tables, this creates a spatial index called <tablename>_SX on the geometry column. The index tiling level is based on the SDO_TUNE.ESTIMATE_TILING_LEVEL function. For tables with fewer than 7500 rows, the tiling level is restricted to eight (8). After the index is built, the ANALYZE table function is run on the index table. The spatial index is R-Tree for Oracle 8.17 or later. Create IDENTITY Column (SQL Server only) Creates the primary key column with IDENTITY properties. When selected, SQL Server automatically generates the primary key column values for new rows, so that you do not need to add them manually. Create Indexes When uploading a new table or replacing an existing table, this indexes all of the columns that are indexed in the original table. By default, this option is not selected. The table upload begins when you select this check box and click OK. If the column name length is too long, the index creation fails. The name length limit varies per database. Style Column Specifies whether per-row styles are loaded with the data. You can set the name of the column in the text box beside the Style Column check box. The default column name is MI_STYLE. To load per-row styles, the MapInfo Map catalog for the database must contain the following columns: RENDITIONTYPE, RENDITIONCOLUMN, RENDITIONTABLE, and NUMBER_ROWS.

MapInfo EasyLoader commits the inserted records when the commit interval is reached. The default commit interval is 1000. If the commit interval is set to 0 (zero), the whole range of records is inserted as a single transaction, before a commit is issued. Table Errors Threshold % A value of zero (0) to 100 that is the percentage of table upload failures allowed before the upload stops. A value of 100 allows the upload to complete no matter the number of failures. Insert Errors Threshold % A value of zero (0) to 100 that is the percentage of insert failures allowed on a table before the table upload stops. The percentage is the number of rows that fail based on the number of rows in the table. A value of 100 allows the process to complete no matter the number of failures. The Error Threshold percentages work together. An insert failure for a row in a table counts towards the Table Errors Threshold.

If you do not supply a schema name, then this flag uses the user's default schema on the server. On SQL Server, the default is usually set to dbo. Syntax: /B string_value Syntax: /SchemaName=string_value /SchemaName=MIPROUSER Create Indices for all Locally-Indexed Columns: /C, /CreateIndexes command-line flags/C ­ Create Indices for all Locally Indexed Columns command-line flags/CreateIndexes When uploading a new table or replacing an existing table, this flag tells MapInfo EasyLoader to automatically index columns on the server table when they are indexed on the local table. This flag does not make or reset column selections. Instead, use the MapInfo EasyLoader user interface. For details, see Create Indexes under Server Table Processing Options and Mixing Command-Line flags and MapInfo EasyLoader Window Options. Syntax: /C Syntax: /CreateIndexes Input Command File: /CF, /CommandFile command-line flags/CF ­ Input Command File command-line flags/CommandFile This flag loads command-line arguments from an input file. Each line in the file must contain only one command. MapInfo EasyLoader skips blank lines and comments that begin with a hash tag (#). You must specify the path to the input file with this flag. You can use the state file that MapInfo EasyLoader automatically creates under the AppData folder with the name MapInfoEasyLoader.Settings.rsp as input. For details, see Locating the MapInfo EasyLoader Command-Line Flags RSP File. You can also generate a state file using the /SaveCommandArgs flag. Syntax: /CF CommandFilePath Syntax: /CommandFile=CommandFilePath /CommandFile=C:MyFilesEasyLoaderCommandsmyCommandFile.txt Convert WKB on Oracle: /ConvertWKBOnOracle command-line flags/ConvertWKBOnOracle This flag passes geometries as WKB (Well-Known Binaries) to an Oracle server for conversion to the SDO_GEOMETRY type. Only use this flag with OCI connections. By default, MapInfo EasyLoader does this conversion before passing geometries to the Oracle server to improve performance. You would only use this flag to work around WKB to SDO_GEOMETRY conversion problems. Syntax: /ConvertWKBOnOracle File Directory for Server Table(s): /D, /OutputFolder command-line flags/D ­ File Directory for Server Tables command-line flags/OutputFolder This flag generates a TAB file in a specific directory location to access a remote database with. The new .tab file name appends _srv.tab to your server table name, yourServerTableName_srv.tab. The directory must be valid to upload a table to it. An empty directory is considered valid. Syntax: /D string_value Syntax: /OutputFolder=string_value If the path contains spaces, use quotation marks around it. /OutputFolder=C:my work folderTablesMy Upload Tables Exclusive Use of Table: /E, /ExclusiveUse command-line flags/E ­ Exclusive Use of Table command-line flags/ExclusiveUse This flag improves load time on large tables when you are the only person updating the table. This flag does not guarantee that MapInfo EasyLoader can obtain exclusive use of a table. After each commit, MapInfo EasyLoader checks the maximum value of the primary key column (called MI_PRINX) to detect if entries were been made by other processes. This flag prevents this check, which improve the upload time for large tables. Syntax: /E Syntax: /ExclusiveUse You can use this flag in a MapInfo EasyLoader shortcut, see Mixing Command-Line flags and MapInfo EasyLoader Window Options. Log File name: /F, /LogFileName command-line flags/F ­ Log File name command-line flags/LogFileName This flag specifies the name and location of the log file created when MapInfo EasyLoader uploads a table. By default, a log file named EasyLoader.log is created in the TEMP directory. If you specify a file name but do not provide a path, then MapInfo EasyLoader saves the log file to the same directory as the EasyLoader.exe file. Syntax: /F string_value Syntax: /LogFileName=string_value This example shows only the name of the log file, which saves to the same directory as MapInfoEasyLoader.exe. /F myLogFile.txt /LogFileName=myLogFile.txt This example specifies the full path for the log file. If the path contains spaces, use quotation marks around it. /F C:my work foldermyLogFile.txt /LogFileName=C:my work foldermyLogFile.txt Table Folder: /Folder command-line flags/Folder This flag loads all tables from a folder. Use a semicolon (;) to separate each element. Syntax: /Folder=FolderName;ServerOperation;AddToMapCatalog;IncludeSubFolders Where: FolderName is the name of the root folder. ServerOperation is the default server operation for the folder, use Append, CreateNew, or Replace. The default is Append. AddToMapCatalog creates an entry for the folder tables in the Map Catalog. This is set to true by default, so set to false to not add an entry in the Map Catalog. IncludeSubFolders includes subfolders when querying for the folder's tables. This is set to true by default, so set to false to not include subfolders in the query. The following example does not include the optional AddToMapCatalog and IncludeSubFolders elements, both of which are set to true by default. /Folder=C:/MyData;CreateNew The following example does not include tables in subfolders under MyData. The third AddToMapCatalog element is blank, because it is set to true by default. /Folder=C:/MyData;CreateNew;;false Grant All: /G, /GrantAll command-line flags/G ­ Grant All command-line flags/GrantAll This flag grants all rights as Public. By default, this is not set and tables are private. Syntax: /G Syntax: /GrantAll Do Not Create a Spatial Index: /I, /NoCreateSpatialIndex command-line flags/I ­ Do Not Create a Spatial Index command-line flags/NoCreateSpatialIndex This flag prevents MapInfo EasyLoader from creating a spatial index on the uploaded table. By default, this flag is turned off and MapInfo EasyLoader creates a spatial index. For Informix Dynamic Server (IDS) and User Defined Object (UDO) tables, MapInfo EasyLoader creates a spatial index and then issues the update statistics medium statement. Syntax: /I Syntax: /NoCreateSpatialIndex For more information, see /NoCreatePrimaryKey, which controls the unique index. Create Automated Key Column for SQL Server: /K, /AutomatedKey command-line flags/K ­ Create Automated Key Column for SQL Server command-line flags/AutomatedKey This flag automatically generates unique key column values in SQL Server, so that you do not need to fill the key manually when you insert a new row. The key column is called MI_PRINX or MI_SQL_REC_NUM depending on the spatial object type that is selected: MI_PRINX is for spatial types and MI_SQL_REC_NUM is for XY types. Syntax: /K [ IDENTITY | NO_IDENTITY ] Syntax: /AutomatedKey [ IDENTITY | NO_IDENTITY ] The key column is created with the IDENTITY property by default, so you do not need to include the IDENTITY property. If you want to turn this off, use the NO_IDENTITY property. /AutomatedKey /AutomatedKey=NO_IDENTITY You can use this flag in an MapInfo EasyLoader shortcut, see Mixing Command-Line flags and MapInfo EasyLoader Window Options. List of MapInfo Tables: /L, /TableList command-line flags/L ­ List of MapInfo Tables command-line flags/TableList This flag specifies a text file that lists the tables to upload. The format of each line in the text file is the same as for Table Specification: /T[able]. Syntax: /L [ TextFile | Path ] Syntax: /TableList=[ TextFile | Path ] Where: TextFile is the name of the text file that lists the tables to upload. Path is the full path location to the text file. This example shows only the name of the file, which is located the same directory as MapInfoEasyLoader.exe. /L ListOfTables.txt This example shows the path to the file. If the path contains spaces, use quotation marks around it. /TableList=C:my work folderTablesListOfTables.txt Spatial Object Type: /M, /SpatialObjectType command-line flags/M MICODE | XY - Spatial Object Type command-line flags/SpatialObjectType This flag specifies the object type to use: either MICODE for XY with MapInfo key or XY for XY only. MapInfo EasyLoader does not display for any value other than MICODE and XY. Syntax: /M [ XY | MICODE ] Syntax: /SpatialeObjectType=[ XY | MICODE ] Examples: /M XY /SpatialObjectType=MICODE Start Application Minimized: /Min, /Minimized command-line flags/Min command-line flags/Minimized This flag starts MapInfo Easyloader in a minimized state. This does not alter the behavior of the /NoStart flag. By default, this is set to false. Syntax: /Min Syntax: /Minimized Do Not Auto Start the Table Load: /NoStart command-line flags/NoStart This flag disables the auto start behavior, so that MapInfo EasyLoader does not automatically connect and begin to upload tables, even if the connection and tables are specified. By default, this is set to false. Syntax: /NoStart Run Without User Interface: /NoUi command-line flags/NoUi This flag runs MapInfo EasyLoader without a user interface. This is useful when running MapInfo EasyLoader from a batch file for auto loading tables. This flag requires a connection and a list of tables to upload. At minimum, you would include a server connection string flag /ConnectionString or the Oracle connection string flag /OracleConnectionString, and a list of MapInfo tables /TableList or a folder of tables /Folder. You do not need to include the /QuitWhenDone flag with /NoUi. Syntax: /NoUi connection tables Where: connection is either /ConnectionString or /OracleConnectionString. tables is either /TableList or /Folder. Connection String: /O, /OracleConnectionString command-line flags/O ­ Connection String command-line flags/OracleConnectionString This flag sets a connection string for Oracle Spatial. Syntax: /O [friendly_name]user_name/password@server_name Where: friendly_name is optional for setting a specific name for the connection identifier. user_name is the Oracle user name to connect with. password is the password for the Oracle user name. server_name is the name of the server you are connecting to. This example sets a connection string without defining a name for the connection identifier. /OracleConnectionString=myUid/myPwd@oraserver11gr2 This example sets the same connection and names the connection Oracle1. If the connection name has spaces, use quotation marks around it. /OracleConnectionString=[Oracle1]myUid/myPwd@oraserver11gr2 For ODBC connections, see Server Connection String: /S, /ConnectionString. Default Server Operation: /P, /ServerOperation command-line flags/P A | C | R ­ Default Server Operation command-line flags/ServerOperation Use this flag to specify what to do with the upload tables in the server. A appends to an existing server table. C creates a new server table. If the table you are uploading has the same name as a table on the server, the upload fails. R replaces an existing server table. Syntax: /P [ A | C | R ] Syntax: /ServerOperation=[ A | C | R ] /P A /SpatialObjectType=C Exit after Upload: /Q command-line flags/Q ­ Exit After Upload command-line flags/QuitWhenDone This flag closes MapInfo EasyLoader after completing the upload. Syntax: /Q Syntax: /QuitWhenDone Server Connection String: /S, /ConnectionString command-line flags/S ­ Connection String command-line flags/ConnectionString This flag passes an ODBC connection string to the program. The ODBC Connection dialog box does not display when you supply enough information to connect. Syntax: /ConnectionString=[ (friendly_name)connection_string | user_name/connection_string ] Where: friendly_name is optional for setting a specific name for the connection identifier. user_name is the Oracle user name to connect with. connection_string is the ODBC connection string. This example uses a data source (DSN). /ConnectionString=DSN=MyDataSource This example sets a connection name to MyDBConnection. It then uses the full connection string to the database, where items in all capitals are connection string parameters. /ConnectionString=[MyDBConnection]UID=MyId;DATABASE=MyDB; HOST=MyServer;SERVER=MyServer_tli;SERVICE=sqlexec;PROTOCOL=onsoctcp This example sets a connection name to My Data Source. It uses a data source (FileDSN=C:TenopMyDataSource.dsn) with a user ID (UID=MyUserID) and password (PWD=MyPassword). If the connection name has spaces, use quotation marks around the entire connection string. /ConnectionString=[My Data Source]FILEDSN=C:TenopMyDataSource.dsn;UID=MyUserID;PWD=MyPassword For ODBC connections, see Connection String: /O, /OracleConnectionString. Save Command Response File: /Save, /SaveCommandArgs command-line flags/Save command-line flags/SaveCommandArgs This flag creates a state file when MapInfo EasyLoader shuts down that contains the command-line arguments used to start MapInfo EasyLoader and that were set during the session. You can use this state file to restart EasyLoader on the command-line with the /CommandFile flag to apply the same settings as the previous session. MapInfo EasyLoader automatically creates a state file that you can also use with the /CommandFile flag. It is located under the AppData folder with the name MapInfoEasyLoader.Settings.rsp (for example, C:Users<UserID>AppDataRoamingMapInfoEasyLoader.Settings.rsp). MapInfo EasyLoader does not create the MapInfoEasyLoader.Settings.rsp file when you use the /SaveCommandArgs flag. The AppData folder is in a path like C:Users<UserID>AppData. If you cannot see the AppData folder, it is because it is hidden. To locate it, on the Microsoft Start menu in the Search programs and files field type %AppData%. Syntax: /SaveCommandArgs=StateFilePath Where, StateFilePath is a TXT file and any valid path location. Example: /SaveCommandArgs=C:MyFilesEasyLoaderCommandsmyCommandFile.txt Table Specification: /T /Table command-line flags/T ­ Table Specification command-line flags/Table This flag passes a single table name to MapInfo EasyLoader. Syntax: /Table=TableName(;ServerTableName;UploadRange;ServerOperation;AddToMapCatalog) Where: TableName is the .tab file name to upload. ServerTableName (optional) is the server table name. If left empty, MapInfo EasyLoader uses TableName. UploadRange (optional) is the range of table rows to upload. The range is a starting number and ending number with a comma (,) separator. A range of three to six would be 3,6. ServerOperation (optional) is the server operation for the table. Use Append, CreateNew, or Replace. AddToMapCatalog creates an entry for the table in the Map Catalog when set to true. By default, this is set to true, so you do not need to specify it in the command-line. This example includes all parameters. /T C:datastates.tab;mystates;1,500;CreateNew;true This example leaves the upload range value empty, so that it uploads all of the rows in the table. It excludes the Map Catalog entry, so an entry is not created for this table in the Map Catalog. /Table=C:datastates.tab;MyOtherStates;;Replace This example includes only the path to the table to upload. /Table=C:dataaTable.tab If the path of the upload file contains spaces, use quotation marks around it. /Table=C:My DocumentstablesaTable.tab;MyTable;;Replace;true Do Not Create a Primary Index: /U, /NoCreatePrimaryKey command-line flags/U ­ Do Not Create a Primary Index command-line flags/NoCreatePrimaryKey This flag prevents MapInfo EasyLoader from creating a primary key when uploading a table. It is turned off by default. When uploading to Oracle Spatial, MapInfo EasyLoader creates a primary key on the MI_PRINX column and names the key table_name_PK. Syntax: /U Syntax: /NoCreatePrimaryKey Also see Do Not Create a Spatial Index: /I, /NoCreateSpatialIndex, which controls the spatial index. Commit Interval: /X, /CommitInterval command-line flags/X ­ Commit Interval command-line flags/CommitInterval This flag sets a commit interval. MapInfo EasyLoader inserts records to the database and then commits them when it reaches the commit interval. The same interval value applies when creating the spatial index for Oracle Spatial. If the commit interval is set to zero (0), MapInfo EasyLoader inserts the entire range of records as a single transaction before issuing a commit. Syntax: /X integer_value Syntax: /CommitInterval=integer_value Where, integer_value is an integer value. The default value is 1000. This example sets the commit interval to 500, so that MapInfo EasyLoader commits all of the records to the database every 500th record. /CommitInterval=500 Style Column Name: /Y, /StyleColumnName command-line flags/Y ­ Style Column Name command-line flags/StyleColumnName This flag loads per-row styles with the upload data. If you do not provide a name for the column to use, MapInfo EasyLoader uses the default MI_STYLE column name. If you do not want to create a style column on the server table, include the NO_STYLE parameter. Syntax: /Y ( string_value ) ( NO_STYLE ) Syntax: /keyword=( string_value ) ( NO_STYLE ) This example uses the column called TableStyleCol to load per-row styles. /Y TableStyleCol /StyleColumnName=TableStyleCol This example uses the default column called MI_STYLE to load per-row styles. /Y /StyleColumnName This example does not create a style column on the server table. /Y NO_STYLE /StyleColumnName=NO_STYLE SQL Server Auto Select Geometry: /Z, /AutoSelectSqlServerSpatial command-line flags/Z ­ SQL Server AuotSelect Geometry command-line flags/AutoSelectSqlServerSpatial Use this flag to upload the table as a Geometry data type in Microsoft SQL Server Spatial regardless of the coordinate system in the native table.
