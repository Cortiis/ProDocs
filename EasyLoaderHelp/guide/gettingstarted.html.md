Getting Started with EasyLoader {#getting-started-with-easyloader .title .topictitle1}
===============================

You can either start EasyLoader from within MapInfo Pro or separately if you downloaded your EasyLoader from the web. To launch EasyLoader from within MapInfo Pro, see [Starting EasyLoader from within MapInfo Pro](guide/startinginpro.html){.- .topic/xref .ajaxLink}.

To start EasyLoader:

<span class="ph cmd">Double-click the <span class="ph filepath">EasyLoader.exe`{.uicontrol} file in the EasyLoader directory.`{.uicontrol}
When you download EasyLoader from the web, you download a zip file. When you extract the files from this zip, it creates an EasyLoader folder with all of the files necessary to run EasyLoader including <span class="ph filepath">EasyLoader.exe`{.uicontrol}.

EasyLoader is a single window within which you can set everything necessary to upload data tables to a database.

<p>You can use existing database connections created from the Microsoft `Start`{.uicontrol} menu or from in MapInfo Pro.

<p>Unless you select not to create them, EasyLoader saves .tab files to your machine that contain database access information. MapInfo Pro uses these files when accessing the tables that EasyLoader uploads. If you select not to create these files, you can create them later from within MapInfo Pro. A live access file has the same name as the upload file with a <span class="ph filepath">_srv`{.uicontrol} extension, such as <span class="ph filepath">YourServerTableName_srv.tab`{.uicontrol}.</p>

<li>`Append All`{.uicontrol} 足 appends all tables to one server table. Select this to create one table for all map layers instead of creating a table for each map layer.</li>
