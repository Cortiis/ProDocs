Table Processing Options {#table-processing-options .title .topictitle1}
========================

<div class="body conbody">

This section describes the table options available in EasyLoader.

<span class="ph uicontrol">Create New Table</span>
:   A server table is created with the name that you specify. If this
    option is chosen and a table with the same name already exists on
    the server, an error message displays, making you aware of
    this problem. Use a different name or choose the option <span
    class="ph uicontrol">Replace Existing Table to upload</span>
    the table.

<span class="ph uicontrol">Replace Existing Table</span>
:   When this option is selected, if a server table of the same name
    already exists, it is dropped and a new table is created to match
    the MapInfo table being uploaded.

<span class="ph uicontrol">Append to Existing Table</span>
:   The MapInfo table is appended to the server table if the server
    table exists and the structure of the two tables match. Otherwise,
    you get an error and the table is not uploaded. The tables must have
    the same table structure and be in the same projection for
    Oracle Spatial.

<span class="ph uicontrol">Append All Tables to One Server Table</span>
:   All MapInfo tables listed are uploaded to a single server table. The
    server table name is the one visible in the <span
    class="ph uicontrol">Server Table</span> box. This feature is meant
    to be used to upload tables with the same structure and projection
    to one table. For example, instead of creating a new table for each
    street layer, check the <span class="ph uicontrol">Append All Tables
    to One Server Table</span> check box, and only one table is created.
    All of the tables are then appended to this table.
:   <div class="note note">

    <span class="notetitle">Note:</span> It is possible that some tables
    will not be appended if their table structure differs.

    </div>

:   If you choose the <span class="ph uicontrol">Replace Existing
    Table</span> option and this check box is selected, the server table
    is dropped, a new table is created, and all tables listed are
    appended to that one. If you select the <span
    class="ph uicontrol">Create New Table</span> option and this check
    box is selected, the server table is created, and all tables listed
    are appended to that one.
:   <div class="note note">

    <span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If this option is chosen, all
    tables must have the same table structure and be in the
    same projection.
