Unregister Tables from the Map Catalog {#unregister-tables-from-the-map-catalog .title .topictitle1}
======================================

The Map Catalog stores the metadata used by MapInfo Pro and other MapInfo products to open tables with geometry data. If your database has a Map Catalog, you can delete entries in the catalog that are no longer valid.

<span class="notetitle">Note:`{.uicontrol} If the Map Catalog is present and there are no entries in it, the `Catalog`{.uicontrol} check box beside the table name in MapInfo EasyLoader does not enable.

To unregister entries from an existing Map Catalog:

1.  <span class="ph cmd">Select the data owner from the `Owner Name`{.uicontrol} drop-down list. The `Tables Registered in Map Catalog`{.uicontrol} list populates with columns of information for each registered table.`{.uicontrol}
2.  <span class="ph cmd">Select the table or tables you want to unregister from the Map Catalog and then click the `Unregister`{.uicontrol} button.`{.uicontrol}
3.  <span class="ph cmd">Click `Close`{.uicontrol} when you are done.`{.uicontrol}

The `Copy`{.uicontrol} button copies the selected rows in a comma separated format to the clipboard, which you can then paste into other applications.
