Unregister Tables from the Map Catalog {#unregister-tables-from-the-map-catalog .title .topictitle1}
======================================

The Map Catalog stores the metadata used by MapInfo Pro and other MapInfo products to open tables with geometry data. If your database has a Map Catalog, you can delete entries in the catalog that are no longer valid.

<span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If the Map Catalog is present and there are no entries in it, the <span class="ph uicontrol">Catalog</span> check box beside the table name in MapInfo EasyLoader does not enable.

To unregister entries from an existing Map Catalog:

1.  <span class="ph cmd">Select the data owner from the <span class="ph uicontrol">Owner Name</span> drop-down list. The <span class="ph uicontrol">Tables Registered in Map Catalog</span> list populates with columns of information for each registered table.</span>
2.  <span class="ph cmd">Select the table or tables you want to unregister from the Map Catalog and then click the <span class="ph uicontrol">Unregister</span> button.</span>
3.  <span class="ph cmd">Click <span class="ph uicontrol">Close</span> when you are done.</span>

The <span class="ph uicontrol">Copy</span> button copies the selected rows in a comma separated format to the clipboard, which you can then paste into other applications.
