Creating an ODBC Connection {#creating-an-odbc-connection .title .topictitle1}
===========================

These instructions assume that you have Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) set up beforehand. You can create new ODBC connections by following these instructions if you know the database name to connect to and the user ID to access the database with.

To connect to a database using <span class="ph uicontrol">ODBC</span>:

1.  <span class="ph cmd">From the <span class="ph uicontrol">Database Connection</span> list, select <span class="ph uicontrol">New Connection</span> and then click the <span class="ph uicontrol">Manage Connection List and Choose Connection</span> ![](images/icon_openDbms_sm.png){.image} button.</span>
2.  <span class="ph cmd">In the <span class="keyword wintitle">Database Connection</span> dialog, select the <span class="ph uicontrol">ODBC</span> radial button and then click the button beside it.</span>
3.  <span class="ph cmd">In the <span class="keyword wintitle">Select Data Source</span> dialog, select an existing ODBC connection by doing one of the following:</span>
    -   On the <span class="ph uicontrol">File Data Source</span> tab, use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Look in</span> drop-down list or the <span class="ph uicontrol">Up</span> button to locate the database you want to upload to and select it.
    -   On the <span class="ph uicontrol">Machine Data Source</span> tab, double-click the data source driver you want to connect to and navigate to the database you want to upload to and select it.

    

    If you do not have an existing ODBC connection, click <span class="ph uicontrol">New</span> to open the <span class="keyword wintitle">Create New Data Source</span> wizard and create one. Select the connection after creating it.

    

4.  <span class="ph cmd">Click <span class="ph uicontrol">OK</span> to use your selection.</span>
    

    The <span class="keyword wintitle">Database Connection</span> dialog populates with the ODBC connection information. Click <span class="ph uicontrol">OK</span> to save your selection.
