Mixing Command-Line Flags and EasyLoader Window Options {#mixing-command-line-flags-and-easyloader-window-options .title .topictitle1}
=======================================================

Command line flags may be mixed with the EasyLoader user interface by using a Windows shortcut. This makes it easier to set flags as your default while being able to override them from the interface. These flags are only available from the command-line.

To create a shortcut for EasyLoader that includes preset flags:

1.  <span class="ph cmd">Right-click on the <span class="ph filepath">EasyLoader.exe`{.uicontrol} file and then select `Send to`{.uicontrol} and `Desktop (create shortcut)`{.uicontrol}. The resulting file saves to your desktop.`{.uicontrol}
    

    To place in a different location, right-click and select `Create shortcut`{.uicontrol}, and then move the resulting shortcut file.

    

2.  <span class="ph cmd">Right-click the shortcut file and select `Properties`{.uicontrol} to open the `Shortcut Properties`{.uicontrol} dialog.`{.uicontrol}
3.  <span class="ph cmd">On the `Shortcut`{.uicontrol} tab, within the `Target`{.uicontrol} edit box, add command-line flags to the end of the path. Separate the flags with spaces.`{.uicontrol}

To have the flags take effect, launch EasyLoader using this shortcut. You can override the settings by changing them in the EasyLoader window.
