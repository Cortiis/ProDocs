Locating the MapInfo EasyLoader Configuration File {#locating-the-mapinfo-easyloader-configuration-file .title .topictitle1}
==================================================

MapInfo EasyLoader saves a configuration file called <span class="ph filepath">MapInfoEasyLoader.Recent.xml</span> to your system under the <span class="ph filepath">%AppData%</span> folder (for example, <span class="ph filepath">C:\\Users\\&lt;UserID&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\MapInfoEasyLoader.Recent.xml</span>).

This file lists the MapInfo EasyLoader settings for the last upload, such as output folder location, connection settings, and data tables uploaded. Look at this file when you experience difficulty uploading your data and you wish to review the upload settings that MapInfo EasyLoader last used.

Do not edit this file. Deleting the configuration file returns MapInfo EasyLoader to its default settings and MapInfo EasyLoader replaces the configuration file when you next start it.

The <span class="ph filepath">AppData</span> folder is in a path like <span class="ph filepath">C:\\Users\\&lt;UserID&gt;\\AppData</span>. If you cannot see the AppData folder, it is because it is hidden. To locate it, on the Microsoft <span class="ph uicontrol">Start</span> menu in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Search programs and files</span> field type %AppData%.
