Locating the MapInfo EasyLoader Configuration File {#locating-the-mapinfo-easyloader-configuration-file .title .topictitle1}
==================================================

<div class="body conbody">

MapInfo EasyLoader saves a configuration file called <span
class="ph filepath">MapInfoEasyLoader.Recent.xml</span> to your system
under the <span class="ph filepath">%AppData%</span> folder (for
example, <span
class="ph filepath">C:\\Users\\&lt;UserID&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\MapInfoEasyLoader.Recent.xml</span>).

This file lists the MapInfo EasyLoader settings for the last upload,
such as output folder location, connection settings, and data tables
uploaded. Look at this file when you experience difficulty uploading
your data and you wish to review the upload settings that MapInfo
EasyLoader last used.

Do not edit this file. Deleting the configuration file returns MapInfo
EasyLoader to its default settings and MapInfo EasyLoader replaces the
configuration file when you next start it.

The <span class="ph filepath">AppData</span> folder is in a path like
<span class="ph filepath">C:\\Users\\&lt;UserID&gt;\\AppData</span>. If
you cannot see the AppData folder, it is because it is hidden. To locate
it, on the Microsoft <span class="ph uicontrol">Start</span> menu in the
<span class="ph uicontrol">Search programs and files</span> field type
%AppData%.
