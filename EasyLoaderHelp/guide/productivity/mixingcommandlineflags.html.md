Mixing Command-Line Flags and MapInfo EasyLoader Window Options {#mixing-command-line-flags-and-mapinfo-easyloader-window-options .title .topictitle1}
===============================================================

Command-line flags may be mixed with the MapInfo EasyLoader user interface by using a Windows shortcut. This makes it easier to set flags as your default while being able to override them from the interface. These flags are only available from the command-line.

To create a shortcut for MapInfo EasyLoader that includes preset flags:

1.  <span class="ph cmd">Right-click on the <span class="ph filepath">MapInfoEasyLoader.exe</span> file and then select <span class="ph uicontrol">Send to</span> and <span class="ph uicontrol">Desktop (create shortcut)</span>. The resulting file saves to your desktop.</span>
    

    To place in a different location, right-click and select <span class="ph uicontrol">Create shortcut</span>, and then move the resulting shortcut file.

    

2.  <span class="ph cmd">Right-click the shortcut file and select <span class="ph uicontrol">Properties</span> to open the <span class="keyword wintitle">Shortcut Properties</span> dialog.</span>
3.  <span class="ph cmd">On the <span class="ph uicontrol">Shortcut</span> tab, within the <span class="ph uicontrol">Target</span> edit box, add command-line flags to the end of the path. Separate the flags with spaces.</span>

To have the flags take effect, launch MapInfo EasyLoader using this shortcut. You can override the settings by changing them in the MapInfo EasyLoader window.
