Locating the MapInfo EasyLoader Command-Line Flags RSP File {#locating-the-mapinfo-easyloader-command-line-flags-rsp-file .title .topictitle1}
===========================================================

Closing MapInfo EasyLoader saves a state file with the command-line flags used on startup and set during the session. The file is called <span class="ph filepath">MapInfoEasyLoader.Settings.rsp`{.uicontrol} and is saved under the <span class="ph filepath">AppData`{.uicontrol} folder (for example, <span class="ph filepath">C:\\Users\\&lt;UserID&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\MapInfoEasyLoader.Settings.rsp`{.uicontrol}).

The <span class="ph filepath">AppData`{.uicontrol} folder is in a path like <span class="ph filepath">C:\\Users\\&lt;UserID&gt;\\AppData`{.uicontrol}. If you cannot see the <span class="ph filepath">AppData`{.uicontrol} folder, it is because it is hidden. To locate it, on the Microsoft `Start`{.uicontrol} menu in the `Search programs and files`{.uicontrol} field type %AppData%.

This file contains all of the flags used to start MapInfo EasyLoader regardless of whether you used the command-line. It includes the default flags and their settings, such as /CommitInterval, /TableUploadErrorThreshold, /InsertRowErrorThreshold, and /StyleColumnName. This flag also records the settings made during the session that affect startup flags. You can use the information in this file to restart EasyLoader via the command-line using the same settings as the previous session.

To customize or automate your MapInfo EasyLoader experience, you can create your own state file by starting MapInfo EasyLoader from the command-line with the [/SaveCommandArgs](guide/productivity/commandlineflags.html#commandlineflags__savecommandargs){.- .topic/xref .ajaxLink} flag. You can then use this state file to restart EasyLoader via the command-line with the [/CommandFile](guide/productivity/commandlineflags.html#commandlineflags__commandfile){.- .topic/xref .ajaxLink} flag to apply the same settings as the previous session. MapInfo EasyLoader does not create the <span class="ph filepath">MapInfoEasyLoader.Settings.rsp`{.uicontrol} file when you use the [/SaveCommandArgs](guide/productivity/commandlineflags.html#commandlineflags__savecommandargs){.- .topic/xref .ajaxLink} flag.
