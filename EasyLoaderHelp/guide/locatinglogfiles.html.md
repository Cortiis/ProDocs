Locating Log Files {#locating-log-files .title .topictitle1}
==================

EasyLoader saves a log file called EasyLoader.log to your <span class="ph filepath">%AppData%\\Local\\Temp`{.uicontrol} folder. This file contains the database connection information currently in use to upload data tables with. You can see the contents of this file from within EasyLoader by clicking `Options`{.uicontrol} and `View Log`{.uicontrol}.

If you experience difficulty uploading your data and you wish to review the upload settings that EasyLoader last used, then look at EasyLoader's recent upload log file. EasyLoader saves information about an upload session in a file called MapInfoEasyLoader.Recent.xml in the <span class="ph filepath">%AppData%\\Roaming`{.uicontrol} folder. This file lists the EasyLoader settings for the last upload, such as output folder location, connection settings, and data tables uploaded.

The <span class="ph filepath">AppData`{.uicontrol} folder is in a path like <span class="ph filepath">C:\\Users\\&lt;UserName&gt;\\AppData`{.uicontrol}. If you cannot see the AppData folder, it is because it is hidden. To locate it, on the Microsoft `Start`{.uicontrol} menu in the `Search programs and files`{.uicontrol} field type %AppData%.
