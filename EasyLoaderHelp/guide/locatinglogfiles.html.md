Locating Log Files {#locating-log-files .title .topictitle1}
==================

<div class="body conbody">

EasyLoader saves a log file called EasyLoader.log to your <span
class="ph filepath">%AppData%\\Local\\Temp</span> folder. This file
contains the database connection information currently in use to upload
data tables with. You can see the contents of this file from within
EasyLoader by clicking <span class="ph uicontrol">Options</span> and
<span class="ph uicontrol">View Log</span>.

If you experience difficulty uploading your data and you wish to review
the upload settings that EasyLoader last used, then look at EasyLoader's
recent upload log file. EasyLoader saves information about an upload
session in a file called MapInfoEasyLoader.Recent.xml in the <span
class="ph filepath">%AppData%\\Roaming</span> folder. This file lists
the EasyLoader settings for the last upload, such as output folder
location, connection settings, and data tables uploaded.

The <span class="ph filepath">AppData</span> folder is in a path like
<span class="ph filepath">C:\\Users\\&lt;UserName&gt;\\AppData</span>.
If you cannot see the AppData folder, it is because it is hidden. To
locate it, on the Microsoft <span class="ph uicontrol">Start</span> menu
in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Search programs and files</span> field
type %AppData%.
