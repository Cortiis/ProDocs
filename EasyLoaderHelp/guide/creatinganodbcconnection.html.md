Creating an ODBC Connection {#creating-an-odbc-connection .title .topictitle1}
===========================

These instructions assume that you have Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) set up beforehand. You can create new ODBC connections by following these instructions if you know the database name to connect to and the user ID to access the database with.

To connect to a database using `ODBC`{.uicontrol}:
